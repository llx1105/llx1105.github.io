there will be times when you want to change the way that data appears for the user without it being changed on the model –
and there will also be times when you want to format how data is saved to the model,
despite how it is entered in the view. Parsers and formatters for perfect for this.

Both parsers and formatters are used in directives and can be accessed within the link method of a directive that requires ngModel.


###Formatters

Formatters change how model values will appear in the view.

Formatters will NOT be called when the model is changed in the view. 

Here is the basic format in which you may choose to a use a parser and a formatter:


```
app.directive('changeCase', function(){
  return{
      restrict: 'A',
      templateUrl: 'scripts/directives/directive_templates/directive.html',
      require: 'ngModel',
      link: function(scope, element, attr, ngModel){

          ngModel.$formatters.push(function(value){

      });

          ngModel.$parsers.push(function(value){
      });

      }
     };
});

```

###Parsers

Parsers change how view values will be saved to the model.

```
var view_value ;
var return_value ;
ngModel.$parsers.push(function(value) {

   if (value.length > 6) {
     return_value = view_value;
     ngModel.$setViewValue(view_value);
     ngModel.$render();
   } else {
     return_value = value;
     view_value = return_value;
   }
    return return_value.toLowerCase();
  });
}
```

The $setViewValue() and $render() methods prevent the user from seeing any more values past 6 characters or numbers typed into the input. Without these, although the modal will remain unchanged the view value can continue to be edited.
